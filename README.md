## Learnings
In this project, I learned how to use Selenium WebDriver to automate web tasks. I gained experience with:

- Initializing and configuring the WebDriver.
- Interacting with web elements using different locators.
- Implementing waits to handle dynamic web content.
- Extracting and printing information from web pages.
